## A Coming Together
I hope this project becomes much more than it is right now, but it was helpful to see everything that I've learned finally come together. I was excited to find an API that shared many of my current interest. I decided to use flexbox to line up most of my app.

## Looking Forward
I'm looking to add some functionality to the settings button next. After that I want it to become a daily meditation rather than a random one!
